# tic-tac-toe-React
Improvements for React tutorial tic-tac-toe game. These files should running on React environment.
The number 4 idea is a little diffcult for me, I should learn more to fill it.
And the number 2 improvement has a bug, maybe I should set a state in the constructor to track what the user clicked before.
